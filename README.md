### Gifaway

This is the first iteration of a tool that will take any video file and split it into gifs of a desired length.

I know there are tools that do the same thing better - there almost always is. I started this as a "I wonder if I could do ...." type project. 

As it stands - it's garbage. It runs, and will accomplish what I say it will, but it's got a lot of holes. 

The fun thing is, I featured it this way. There's an accompanying video that dives into the process _as well_ as the direction the tool should head next if someone would ever actually want to release it.

It's just as important to see process as finished product, I hope that seeing this can give someone the comfort in knowing that a lot of little pet tools started out cobble together functionality.
